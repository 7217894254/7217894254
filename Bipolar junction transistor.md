<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
<p><i>During the period 1904-1947, the vacuum tube was undoubtedly the electronic de-
vice of interest and development. In 1904, the vacuum-tube diode was introduced by
J. A. Fleming. Shortly thereafter, in 1906, Lee De Forest added a third element, called
the control grid, to the vacuum diode, resulting in the first amplifier, the triode. In
the following years, radio and television provided great stimulation to the tube in-
dustry. Production rose from about 1 million tubes in 1922 to about 100 million in
1937. In the early 1930s the four-element tetrode and five-element pentode gained
prominence in the electron-tube industry. In the years to follow, the industry became
one of primary importance and rapid advances were made in design, manufacturing
techniques, high-power and high-frequency applications, and miniaturization.
On December 23, 1947, however, the electronics industry was to experience the
advent of a completely new direction of interest and development. It was on the af-
ternoon of this day that Walter H. Brattain and John Bardeen demonstrated the am-
plifying action of the first transistor at the Bell Telephone Laboratories. The advantages of this three-
terminal solid-state device over the tube were immediately obvious: It was smaller 
and lightweight; had no heater requirement or heater loss; had rugged construction
and was more efficient since less power was absorbed by the device itself; it was in
stantly available for use, requiring no warm-up period; and lower operating voltages
were possible.</i></p>

  
<h3>WHAT IS BJT(BIPOLAR JUNCTION TRANSISTOR)?</h3>
<p>A bipolar junction transistor is a three-terminal semiconductor device that consists 
of two p-n junctions which are able to amplify or magnify a signal. It is a current controlled
 device. The three terminals of the BJT are the base, the collector, and the emitter.
 A signal of a small amplitude applied to the base is available in the amplified form at the
 collector of the transistor. This is the amplification provided by the BJT.</p>

  
  
  
  
<h3>CONSTRUCTION OF BJT(BIPOLAR JUNCTION TRANSISTOR)</h3>
<p>BJT is a semiconductor device that is constructed with 3 doped semiconductor
 Regions i.e. Base, Collector & Emitter separated by 2 p-n Junctions.

Bipolar transistors are manufactured in two types, PNP and NPN, and are 
available as separate components, usually in large quantities. The prime use or
 function of this type of transistor is to amplify current. This makes them useful
 as switches or amplifiers. They have a wide application in electronic devices like
 mobile phones, televisions, radio transmitters, and industrial control.</p>

<h3>Operation of BJT(BIPOLAR JUNCTION TRANSISTOR)</h3>
<p>There are three operating regions of a bipolar junction transistor:

<p><li>Active region: The region in which the transistors operate as an amplifier.</li></p>
<p><li>Saturation region: The region in which the transistor is fully on and operates as
 a switch such that collector current is equal to the saturation current.</li></p>
<p><li>Cut-off region: The region in which the transistor is fully off and collector current is equal to zero.</li></p>

<h3>Types of BJT(BIPOLAR JUNCTION TRANSISTOR)</h3>
<p>There are two types of bipolar junction transistors</p>
<p>1.PNP bipolar junction transistor</p>
<p>2.NPN bipolar junction transistor</p>

<h3>PNP bipolar junction transistor</h3>
<p>In PNP BJT, the n-type semiconductor is sandwiched between the two p-type semiconductors. 
The two p-type semiconductorsact as emitter and collector respectively while the n-type semiconductor acts as a base.
The current enters the transistor through the emitter such that the emitter-base junction is 
forward biased and the collector-base junction is reverse biased.
</p>




<h3>WORKING OF PNP bipolar junction transistor</h3>
<p>The positive terminal of a voltage source (VEB) is connected with Emitter (P-type) and the negative terminal is connected with the Base terminal (N-type). Therefore, the Emitter-Base junction is connected in forward bias.

And the positive terminal of a voltage source (VCB) is connected with the Base terminal (N-type) and the negative terminal is connected with the Collector terminal (P-type). Hence, the Collector-Base junction is connected in reverse bias.</p>
<p>Due to this type of bias, the depletion region at Emitter-Base junction is narrow, because it is connected in forward bias. While the Collector-Base junction is in reverse bias and hence the depletion region at Collector-Base junction is wide.

The Emitter-base junction is in forward bias. Therefore, a very large number of holes from emitter cross the depletion region and enter the Base. Simultaneously, very few electrons enter in Emitter from the base and recombine with the holes.

The loss of holes in the emitter is equal to the number of electrons present in the Base layer. But The number of electrons in the Base is very small because it is a very lightly doped and thin region. Therefore, almost all holes of Emitter will cross the depletion region and enter into the Base layer.

Because of the movement of holes, the current will flow through the Emitter-Base junction. This current is known as Emitter current (IE). The holes are majority charge carriers to flow the Emitter current.

The remaining holes which do not recombine with electrons in Base, that holes will further travel to the Collector. The Collector current (IC) flows through the Collector-Base region due to holes.</p>




<h3>NPN bipolar junction transistor</h3>
<p>In NPN BJT, p-type semiconductor is sandwiched between the two n-type semiconductors. The two n-type semiconductors
 act as emitter and collector respectively while the p-type semiconductor acts as a base.
Current entering the emitter, base, and collector has the sign convention of positive while the current that leaves 
the transistor has the sign convention of negative.</p>



<h3>WORKING OF NPN bipolar junction transistor</h3>
<p>The forward biased is applied across the emitter-base junction, and the reversed biased is applied across the collector-
base junction. The forward biased voltage VEB is small as compared to the reverse bias voltage VCB.</p>
<p>The emitter of the NPN transistor is heavily doped. When the forward bias is applied across the emitter, the majority charge 
carriers move towards the base. This causes the emitter current IE. The electrons enter into the P-type material and combine with the holes.</p>
<p>The base of the NPN transistor is lightly doped. Due to which only a few electrons are combined and remaining constitutes the base current IB. This base current enters into the collector region. The reversed bias potential of the collector region applies the high attractive force on the electrons reaching collector junction. Thus attract or collect the electrons at the collector.

The whole of the emitter current is entered into the base. Thus, we can say that the emitter current is the sum of the collector and the base current.</p>






<h3>Function of Bipolar Junction Transistor</h3>
<p>BJTs are of two types namely NPN and PNP based on doping types of the three main terminals. 
An NPN transistor consists of two semiconductor junctions that have a thin p-doped anode region
 and PNP transistor also consists of two semiconductor junctions that have a thin n- doped cathode region.
The flow of charge in a Bipolar transistor is due to the diffusion of charge carriers between the two 
regions belonging to different charge concentrations. Regions of BJT are known as the base, collector, and emitter.

The emitter region is highly doped when compared to other layers. Both collector and base layers have the
 same charge carrier concentrations. Among these junctions, the base-emitter junction is forward biased, and the
 base-collector junction is reverse biased. Forward biased means p-doped region has more potential than the n-doped side.</p>





<h3>Configuration of Bipolar Junction Transistors</h3>
<p>Since a Bipolar Junction Transistor is a three-terminal device, there are three ways to connect it within an electric
 circuit while one terminal is the same for both output and input. Every method of connection responds differently 
to the input signals within a circuit.</p>
<p><li>Common Emitter Configuration â€“ has both voltage and current gain</li></p>
<p><li>The common Collector Configuration â€“ has no voltage gain but has a current gain</li></p>
<p><li>The common Base configuration â€“ has no current gain but has a voltage gain</li></p>
<p><b>Characteristics of different transistor configurations are given in the following table:</b></p>
